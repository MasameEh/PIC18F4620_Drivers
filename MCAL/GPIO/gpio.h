 * File:   gpio.h
 * Author: Mohamed Sameh
 * 
 * Description:
 * This header file provides the interface and data structures for controlling GPIO pins and ports.
 * The functions defined in this file allow setting the direction, writing logic levels, reading logic levels,
 * toggling, and initializing GPIO pins and ports. The header also defines various macros and enumerations
 * for easy manipulation of GPIO pins and ports.
